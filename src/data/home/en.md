title: Rabbi Rafael Cohen – Founder and Head of the Institutions and Kollel
---

Rabbi Cohen was a close student of Moreinu HaRav Moshe Shapira zt'l for more than 20 years.

Rav Shapira zt'l encouraged Rabbi Cohen to start studying the hidden wisdom of the Torah according to the path of the "Leshem Shevo V’achlama" (Rav Shlomo Elyashiv zt’l) and later encouraged and pushed Rabbi Cohen to start teaching the writings of the Ariza’l and the Leshem.

In addition, Rabbi Cohen has been close to HaRav Mordechai Gross shlit’a for many years and has served as a moreh horaah in Rav Gross' bet horaah. Rav Gross knows, appreciates, and supports Rabbi Cohen's practice in the Kollel and in the teaching of the inner aspects of the Torah to highly esteemed avrechim.

Rabbi Cohen founded the institution with a vision to enable serious avrechim who seek wisdom to acquire this area of the Torah in addition to the studies of Halacha, Sha’s and Poskim.

The Kollel enables them to engage in the complex study of the inner depths of the Torah every day as part of their daily framework. This can transform them into talmidei chachamim in the hidden part of Torah no less than in the revealed part.

This vision is in accordance with the perception and guidance of Rav Shapira zt’l, to be "professionals" in both parts of the Torah - revealed and hidden. The establishment of the Kollel was for this reason as instructed by Rav Shapira zt’l.

Rabbi Cohen endeavours with all his strength to place his students in this Torah ‘’profession’’. He is moser nefesh to raise the funds for the continuation of the Kollel to achieve this lofty goal of learning the inner aspects of the Torah.

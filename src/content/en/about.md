Kollel "Avnei Shelomo" by the"Chasdai Gavriel" organization is a unique Kollel in which the Avrechim not only learn Gemara and Poskim for Halacha but also learn the very deep and special Derech of understanding the Kabala and Kitvey Ha'Arizal of the Leshem Shevo Ve'Achlama of זצוק“ל Harav Shlomo Elyashiv

The Kollel was established with the זצ“ל encouragement of Harav Moshe Shapiro
I was blessed to be his Talmid for 20 years He introduced me to this area of learning and instructed me to begin giving Shiurim and later to open this Kollel. He felt this was the correct way to give Avrechim the option to learn this part of Torah with the same depth and rigor with which they learn the other parts of Torah.

We have seen that influence on the Avrechim is amazing, whether in their Limud or in their Tefila and Avodat Hashem in general.
I ask you to become a partner in the Hatzlacha of this unique Kollel and in supporting its Torah learning.

The Zechut of the Leshem will strengthen you and your family for all time.

Thank you very much & Tizku l'Mitzvot
